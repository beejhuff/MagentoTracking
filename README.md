MagentoTracking
===============

A magento module that allows tracking code to be added via adminhtml configuration. During my time working with Magento
a common request is to add tracking code to two main areas of Magento ( Header and footer ). In the past this has been done
directly in the templates and over time the templates become cluttered with tracking codes.

This module help by having an admin interface showing what tracking is enabled on the site and will allow administration
of the tracking codes to be made.
